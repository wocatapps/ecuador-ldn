This is the source code for a google earth engine app that aims to support decision-making to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality in Ecuador by identifying priority areas for the implementation of sustainable management practices and the integration of qualitative and quantitative indicators relevant to the monitoring and evaluation of land degradation.

Ecuador LDN Google Earth Engine app: [https://wocatapps.users.earthengine.app/view/ldn-ecuador](https://wocatapps.users.earthengine.app/view/ldn-ecuador).

All the data layers, both raster and vectors, are available to use or download as GEE Assets. The links can be found in the same code together with the visualization parameters that were used.
